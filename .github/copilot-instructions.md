This project is a Python module with a driver script that:
- Interactively queries the user for a viral species name
- Queries NCBI to find the Taxonomy ID for the species
- Queries NCBI to find the RefSeq IDs associated with the Taxonomy ID
- Queries the user to select from among the available RefSeq IDs
- Uses the NCBI Datasets API to download the selected RefSeqs and all GenBank genomes associated with the Taxonomy ID
